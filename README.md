# Where Your Health Dollars Go

Increase literacy and Improve discussions surrounding issues within the US healthcare system by designing a real-time system level view of its components and their interactions within.


### Detailed summary

Design and build Where Your Health Dollars Go, an interactive tool to explore the real-time picture of the US healthcare system and its components, by researching and utilizing public materials on the subject and with collaboration from healthcare professionals with a system level lens. Utilize real world healthcare system data (government investment, private investment, # of hospitals, # of health professionals, # of patients, etc) to add a quantitative layer to the Viewer. Use existing APIs to automatically update this data in order to have a continually evolving yet accurate view of the current state of US healthcare from a system infrastructure lens, not a population health lens. 

### Goals

We aim to improve US healthcare system understanding by building a tool for communication:
1. Map of US healthcare system components for professionals working within the domain
2. View allocation and flow of investment within the healthcare system
3. Provide a “map” for communicating healthcare issues at the policy level
4. Provide a “map” on which to place health services and products
5. Data and community-driven evolution (wiki-like editing and near-real time renders of updates)
6. GUI admin tool for editing and adding to model

### Why are we building this?

• A detailed high level view of all components within the US healthcare system and how they interact do not currently exist. 
The US healthcare system is extremely convoluted. Being like “spaghetti” is not an inaccurate description. Because of this, public discourse around US healthcare issues and reforms are often too narrow in context.<br/>
• It is difficult to see how money is flowing through the US healthcare system. This is primarily due to the complexity of the system, which makes accurately capturing and following this data difficult, but it can also be attributed to the lack of consolidation of existing information to elucidate the wider picture.<br/>
• A consolidated, continually updating database of basic healthcare statistics that is both easy to navigate and understand does not currently exist.<br/>
• Many consumer health services and products being built in the health technology space do not consider all longer term, secondary, tertiary, downstream effects of what is being developed. A map in which to place these services and products is required in order to drive development that aligns with our health values.
